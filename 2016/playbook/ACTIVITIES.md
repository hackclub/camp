# Energizers

## Evolution Rock Paper Scissors

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-30
Source: Andrea
```

Everyone starts off in the “egg” stage and has to act like eggs like being in a squatting position. Every “egg” will find another “egg” to play rock paper scissors with. Play rock paper scissors until someone wins 2 out of 3. The person that wins the rps round will then evolve into the next stage, which is “chicken,” and has to find another “chicken” to play rock paper scissors with. The “losing” person will remain an egg and find other eggs to play rock paper scissors with. The stages are egg to chicken to monkey to human then to divine being. In each stage, the “losing” person will de-evolve into the previous stage or if an egg will remain an egg. So if you lose when you're a chicken, then you become an egg again. Once a person becomes a divine being he/she leaves the game and watches.

Continue until you have a certain number of divine beings agreed upon at the beginning of the game.

For example, assume there are 6 people, and they all default start at the "egg" stage. There will be 3 rounds of rock paper scissors total, so egg1 - egg2, egg3 - egg4, egg5 - egg6. There will then be 3 winners, so chicken1 egg2 egg3 chicken4 egg5 chicken6, for example. Then, there will be 2 rounds going on, since there are an odd number of chickens and eggs: chicken1 - chicken6, egg2 - egg3, while chicken4 and egg5 wait for partners. Then when people lose, an example scenario is: egg1, monkey6, chicken2, egg3, chicken4, and egg5. This continues until there are a specific number of divine beings you decide upon.

## Fortunately, Unfortunately

```
Time: 5-10 minutes
Number: 3-5
```

Break up into groups of an odd number of hackers. The first person will say the first line of a news report. Then, each camper will add a sentence to the story that starts with "Fortunately" or "Unfortunately" (alternating each sentence).

> Today someone fell out of a plane.

> Fortunately, they were skydiving.

> Unfortunately, they forgot to bring a parachute.

> Fortunately, they were over the ocean so the water could break their fall.

> Unfortunately, there were sharks in the ocean.

## Human Pictionary

```
Time: 10 min
Materials: none
Team sizes:

- when 4-8 people, group into teams of size 2
- when 9-12 people, group into teams of size 3
- when 13+ people, group into teams of size 4 or 5
```

- Organize the students get into teams.
- Announce that there is no talking in this activity
- Facilitator(s) will call out a random prompt (e.g. iPhone, giraffe, surfboard) and start the 30 second timer.
- Each team tries to represent that the prompt with their bodies in that time.
- At the end of the 30 seconds, everyone will freeze as the facilitator(s) goes around and judges the teams and makes funny and comments.
- "This group is trying really hard not to fall. It really does look like the leaning tower of Pizza. Bonus points on being very angled."
- After observing all the groups, the facilitator announces the winner.
- The facilitator tells the winning team gets to pick, announce, and judge the next round.
- You can repeat this for the duration you want this activity.

## I Love My Neighbor Who

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-35
```

- Get everyone into a circle
- Facilitator starts "in the middle" by filling in “My name is _____. I love my neighbor who _____” with anything that applies to him/her such as “I love my neighbor who dances.” or “I love my neighbor who loves sushi”.
- People whom the statement also applies to have to move and find another spot in the circle.
- The last person trying to find a spot will then become the next person in the middle. He/she will fill in the statement “My name is _____. I love my neighbor who _____”.
- The pattern continues. If someone is in the middle more than once you can have someone who hasn’t been in the middle go in instead so we get to know everyone’s names.
- You can also encourage people to say things that apply to them that they don't think will apply to others. That way, it gets people to share things that they think "could only apply to them" and when they realize when it applies to someone else, bonding happens.

## One Word Radio

```
Time: 15 min
Materials: none
Team sizes:

- when 4-9 people, group into teams of 2 or 3
- when 9+, group into teams no larger than 4
```

- In this activity, teams of people will be taking turns acting as a radio station.
- The first team will stand on one side of the room while everyone else (the audience) comes up with a topic on the news.
- The audience will tell the news team what they have to broadcast.
- The news team must give a news broadcast one word at a time, switching between each person on the team each word.

> a: Today
> b: the
> c: White
> a: House
> b: put
> c: a
> a: ban
> b: on
> c: cookies

## Pictionary

```
Time: 10 min
Materials: whiteboard and marker
```

One person will think of a topic to draw on the whiteboard while everyone else tries to guess what it is. Whoever guesses right will be the next person to draw on the whiteboard.

## Two Truths and a Lie

```
Time: 10 minutes
Materials: Lots of floor space for running
Number: 6 - 10 people
```

> Ask all players to arrange themselves in a circle. Instruct each player to think of three statements about themselves. Two must be true statements, and one must be false. For each person, he or she shares the three statements (in any order) to the group. The goal of the icebreaker game is to determine which statement is false. The group votes on which one they feel is a lie, and at the end of each round, the person reveals which one was the lie.

## Zip Zap Zop

```
Time: 4 - 8 minutes
Materials: none
Number: unknown
```

- Spend 15 seconds verbally explaining the game
- Then you want to SHOW the game. Grab 3 people and have to demo it like [this](https://youtu.be/lyWKVGoXKak?t=50s).

## Code of conduct

It is extremely important for us that Hack Camp is a safe space for each and every hacker (yes, you are a hacker). That means that it is your job to make sure that you do your best to make this a comfortable space for other people.

# Demos

Demos are a great way to show off what you've been building.

So most people here probably think about demoing in the sense of showing off a polished project. This is NOT that.

Demos in Hack Camp are for showing off what you've got done so far in a project, even if it's not done. They're a great way of getting feedback from viewers and sharing your experience with others. You've just gone through the hard work of making a project in a short amount of time – now it's your chance to show the world how you've progressed and what you've learned.

As part of this, we encourage you present something you failed at as part of your demo. Double points for something you still haven't resolved yet – other campers may have struggled with similar issues and can help you.

Step-by-step instructions for presenting:

1. Start showing your project being used.
2. Talk about how your project works.
3. Something you have failed at (and optionally how you will resolve it).
4. Something you have learned by doing this project.

# Feedback Forms

Feedback is being collected by [Howdy](https://howdy.ai/), our lovable Slackbot. Responses will be recorded in the [spreadsheet][hack_camp_spreadsheet] under the 'Feedback' sheet.

[hack_camp_spreadsheet]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HCh5YtN_Y3JXbIMoiUdv-FgYiPZZD1kGg5QnfbsxiCw/edit#gid=1669794560

# Using Slack

We've gone ahead and created a Slack for Hack Camp over at https://starthackclub.slack.com to use as a place for communicating with hackers during the camp.

## Asking for help

If a hacker says `@hackcamp` in anywhere besides a PM in the Slack, all of the technical mentors and staff for Hack Camp will be pinged. 

If you'd like to be added/removed from the list, please let [@MaxWofford](https://github.com/MaxWofford) ([@msw](https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/@msw/) on Slack) know.
