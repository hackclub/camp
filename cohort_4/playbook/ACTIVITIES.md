# Hacker arrival

1. Assign two leaders to manage hacker arrival and one leader to manage scanning
   of acceptance packets.
2. Have the assigned leaders text all of the hackers the morning of with
   something along the lines of the following:

  > Hey Alice! Can't wait to see you this morning. Just as a quick reminder,
  > the address is 44 Tehama Street in San Francisco. Can you shoot me a text
  > or give me a call when you get here?

3. Have the assigned leaders wait in the lobby for arriving hackers.
4. When a hacker arrives, have one of the assigned leaders guide them down to
   the hackerspace in the basement, mark their arrival in the
   [attendance sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Em5tUQdm4dXnthtWr4zY4KR9Q6JZMV_Hl2n6G9Ti9Bg/edit),
   collect and set aside their acceptance packet (they were emailed a packet
   full of waivers to sign before the cohort started), and then head back up to
   the lobby to wait for more arriving hackers.
5. Have the leader assigned for managing acceptance packets make sure they are
   scanned and uploaded to the shared Google Drive folder before the day is
   over.

It may be a good idea to play some music in the hackerspace while people are
arriving.

# Energizers

## Where The West Wind Blows

## Human Pictionary

```
Time: 10 min
Materials: none
Team sizes:

- when 4-8 people, group into teams of size 2
- when 9-12 people, group into teams of size 3
- when 13+ people, group into teams of size 4 or 5
```

- Organize the students get into teams.
- Announce that there is no talking in this activity
- Facilitator(s) will call out a random prompt (e.g. iPhone, giraffe, surfboard)
  and start the 30 second timer.
- Each team tries to represent that the prompt with their bodies in that time.
- At the end of the 30 seconds, everyone will freeze as the facilitator(s) goes
  around and judges the teams and makes funny and comments.
  - "This group is trying really hard not to fall. It really does look like the
    leaning tower of Pizza. Bonus points on being very angled."
- After observing all the groups, the facilitator announces the winner.
- The facilitator tells the winning team gets to pick, announce, and judge the
  next round.
- You can repeat this for the duration you want this activity.

## I Love My Neighbor Who

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-35
```

- Get everyone into a circle
- Facilitator starts "in the middle" by filling in “My name is _____. I love my
  neighbor who _____” with anything that applies to him/her such as “I love my
  neighbor who dances.” or “I love my neighbor who loves sushi”.
- People whom the statement also applies to have to move and find another spot
  in the circle.
- The last person trying to find a spot will then become the next person in the
  middle. He/she will fill in the statement “My name is _____. I love my
  neighbor who _____”.
- The pattern continues. If someone is in the middle more than once you can have
  someone who hasn’t been in the middle go in instead so we get to know
  everyone’s names.
- You can also encourage people to say things that apply to them that they don't
  think will apply to others. That way, it gets people to share things that they
  think "could only apply to them" and when they realize when it applies to
  someone else, bonding happens.

## Evolution Rock Paper Scissors

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-30
Source: Andrea
```

Everyone starts off in the “egg” stage and has to act like eggs like being in a
squatting position. Every “egg” will find another “egg” to play rock paper
scissors with. Play rock paper scissors until someone wins 2 out of 3. The 
person that wins the rps round will then evolve into the next stage, which is 
“chicken,” and has to find another “chicken” to play rock paper scissors with. 
The “losing” person will remain an egg and find other eggs to play rock paper 
scissors with. The stages are egg to chicken to monkey to human then to divine 
being. In each stage, the “losing” person will de-evolve into the previous 
stage or if an egg will remain an egg. So if you lose when you're a chicken, 
then you become an egg again.  Once a person becomes a divine being he/she 
leaves the game and watches.
Continue until you have a certain number of divine beings agreed upon at the
beginning of the game.

For example, assume there are 6 people, and they all default start at the 
"egg" stage.  There will be 3 rounds of rock paper scissors total, so 
egg1 - egg2, egg3 - egg4, egg5 - egg6.  There will then be 3 winners, so 
chicken1 egg2 egg3 chicken4 egg5 chicken6, for example.  Then, there will 
be 2 rounds going on, since there are an odd number of chickens and eggs:
chicken1 - chicken6, egg2 - egg3, while chicken4 and egg5 wait for partners.
Then when people lose, an example scenario is: egg1, monkey6, chicken2, 
egg3, chicken4, and egg5.  This continues until there are a specific number 
of divine beings you decide upon.   

# Introduction talk

Welcome to Hack Camp.

## Speaking from personal experience.

First of all, I wanted to preface that everything we say at Hack Camp comes from
our own personal experiences. None of the things that I say are necessarily
right, they are just how I feel. Each of us here, has different opinions and we
will each share our own views and opinions.

## Why is programming awesome?

- Make School Founder Jeremy Rossman had a really inspirational speech
- The smartphone in your pocket is more powerful than the computer we used to
  send a human to the moon.
- 30 years ago, our smartphones would have been considered more powerful than a
  super computer.
- 30 years before that it would have been considered magic.
- If you walked around in the early 20th century with an iPhone, people would
  think you could weild magic.
- And in a world where magic exists, there are people who know how to use magic,
  and then there are muggles.
- You want to be in category A.
- You want to know how to control the devices that can do millions of
  calculations per second, not for whom those those devices are a mystery
- Every year that goes by, there are more and more industries that can be
  transformed by computers. In fact, it's hard to think of an industry that
  won't be disrupted by technology
- There are industries that are radically changed by these devices every year
- If you were the king of the Roman Empire in 25, you would have ruled over 56.8
  million people
- By 2016, 2 billion consumers will have smartphones
- And you, if you can learn to weild magic, just sitting in your underwear in
  your bedroom, can create expreinces that impact 2 billion lives.

### Our objective running Hack Camp.

You might think that it is my objective for me to teach you this skill of
programming.

Sure, programming has been a very useful tool for me.

However, learning and viscerally feeling that I can create what I see missing in
the world, that I didn't have to follow all of the rules, that really changed
the way I looked at the world.

My goal here at Hack Camp is to share that feeling like that is a possibility.

I want to show you a
[brief clip with Steve Jobs](https://youtu.be/kYfNvmF0Bqw?t=15s) that I think
sums this up well.

And the first step in being able to create what you see missing in the world is
viscerally believing that you are capable of doing it.

### Sports Analogy

Let's take a look at sports for a second.

*If I went went on a run, how might I know if I've gotten a good exercise?*

> Wait

Yeah, when I'm out of breath and my muscles start burning.

*Should I exercise as much as an olympic athele?*

> Wait

No, of course not, I can barely run `insert how much you actually run` right
now. I might actually die if I did that.

*Should the exercise an olympic athelte does be easy for them?*

No of course not. They should be equally as out of breath and having their
muscles burned if not more.

*So why are olympic atheletes more fit than me? Are they just born more fit?*

> Wait for response

No, they've just practiced and exercised many *many*, more hours than I have.

*Well for programming, how might you know that you've gotten a good exercise?*

> Wait

When you don't know how to do something, and you start getting confused, and
your brain starts hurting. That's when you have gotten a good exercise.

*What does it mean if you don't get confused, your brain doesn't hurt, and you
 know everything?*

It means that you're not learning anything new. You're just doing really boring
easy things and not stretching yourself.

### Growth Mindset

I want to share a piece of research with you that has really impacted the way I
thought about myself.

A Stanford University professor named Carol Dweck studies this phenomenon she
calls mindset.

On one side of the mindset scale is fixed mindset, which means that you believe
that your abilities in something are fixed.

On the other side of the mindset scale is growth mindset, which means that you
believe that your abilities in something can be improved.

If I were to say, I'm not really a math person, that means that you believe that
your abilities in math are fixed. That you were born with some finite set of
math abilities and they couldn't be improved.

If I were to say, "Yeah, I'm not really that artistic" it means that you think
that your art abilities are fixed. That you were born with a limited artistic
ability and you couldn't improve it.

If I were to say, "Yeah, I'm not that good with girls and I'm not that good with
boys either, you believe that your ability with men or women is fixed."

If you had a growth mindset about math, you might instead say "I'm not that good
at math right now because I havn't spent too much time practicing it because I'm
not too intrested in it"

If you had a growth mindset about art, you might say that I don't really have
too much experience in art right now so I'm pretty bad at it but I'm actually
pretty interested in it and would love to learn more.

So there are people here of all different skill levels of programming in this
room. Take `INSERT NAME OF PERSON HERE THAT IS BETTER AT CODING THAN YOU WHO IS
IDEALLY IN THE ROOM OR AT LEAST THAT SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS ABOUT`, they are much
better than me at programming. Now why is that? Is it because they are just
smarter than me?

> Wait for answer

No, it's because they've spent a lot more hours programming than I have.

So when you're learning something, should you be learning the same concepts and
building as quickly `ABOVE NAME`. Should you be picking up things at the same
rate?

No, of course not! They have spent a lot more time practicing as you. Once
you've spent as many hours (note hours, not years) as them, then you can expect
similar results.

There's an interesting experiment that they did with this:

She gave an exam to engineering students who she told was a measure of their
aptitude. They made sure that they did well on 2 of the tests but not on a
third.

Then they asked, which one do you want to take a tutorial in? After the
tutorial, we'll give you the test for that subject again and give you a
certificuit with a score emblazed on a certificuit.

Those with a growth mindset overwhelmingly chose to take the tutorial in the
subject that they did poorly on.

This seems to make sense because they can improve the skill they are the weakest
on.

However, those with a fixed mindset overwhelmingly chose to take the tutorial in
one of the subjects they did well on.

For those with fixed mindsets, errors and setbacks are calamaties, they are the
surest sign of unworthyness and they think, "I must hide my errors, I must not
let people know or else they will think I am stupid". This fear of errors in
those with a fix mindset closes people off to learning and growth.

When researcher from the University of Michigan, Jason Moser monitored brain
activity while someone with a growth mindset makes an error, the anterior
cingulate cortex, the part of the brain that monitors for errors, is extremely
active and processing.

And if you actually look at brain activity of someone with a fixed mindset, this
area of the brain is completely shut off.

At hack camp, we want to celebrate learning so we want to celebrate when we make
errors.

*So is the primary objective of Hack Camp to learn coding?*

No, not really. Think about this as an analog to a creative writing camp. You
wouldn't spend all day in a creative writing camp learning grammar.

You would be there thinking about what stories you could craft, how you could
move people's emotions, how you could sway someone's opinions.

I see programming as a tool for two things.

- a medium for self expression
- a tool to solve problems

and the most important part of doing those two things is knowing that you can do
it. This is what hack camp is about.

*Don't Ask For Permission, beg for forgiveness*

Don't ask us whether you can do something or not in hack-camp, just do it.

Ask us for forgiveness later.

There are no rules at hack camp, except one.

### Code of conduct

It is extremely important for us that Hack Camp is a safe space for each and
every hacker (yes, you are a hacker). That means that it is your job to make
sure that you do your best to make this a comfortable space for other people.

### Freedom

Therefore, everything at Hack Camp is optional. If you ever ask, do I really
"have to do this", the answer is no, you don't. That being said however, in Hack
Camp we will be following a set schedule, and if you'd like to deviate, please
do so. However, if you don't follow along with the workshops or don't build
projects in the schedule, you might be able to go in more of a direction you may
want to go in but there's also a chance that you'll fall behind - the choice is
up to you.

# Meals

## Breakfast

Plan to eat breakfast as a large group every morning on the third floor of the
building.

How to get it going:

1. Assign a leader to set up breakfast while hackers are still arriving.
2. To set up breakfast, the leader will need to:
  1. Bring the food we have for breakfast from the kitchen to the third floor
     dining tables. Our food is in the cabinets below the stove in the kitchen
     past the open working space on the third floor (not the kitchen right next
     to the stairs).
  2. Move tables together and bring chairs together.
  3. Bring out an adequate number of plates, bowls, and silverware (use
     discretion to decide what is adequate).
3. Once the leader has set up breakfast, and when it's time to do breakfast,
   have everyone take the stairs to the third floor.

The hackers may be pretty quiet during breakfast, especially on the first day.
We recommend taking this opportunity as a time to engage with them on a more
personal level and start building community within the cohort. The way we've
done this in the past is physically dispersing ourselves between the hackers
during breakfast and initiating conversations with the one or two people sitting
next to us through asking lots of open ended questions. We haven't had much
success when trying to engage the entire group in a single large conversation.

Plan to start cleaning up 5 minutes before breakfast ends. Make it clear to all
of the hackers that they are expected to clean up after themselves, whether that
means putting their dishes in the dishwasher or disposing of garbage.

## Lunch

On the first day, eat lunch as a large group. On all of the other days, give the
hackers freedom for the entire lunch period.

When eating lunch as a large group, eat on the _roof_. When doing this, _assign
one leader_ to go to the roof _15-20 minutes early_ and move tables and chairs
together to accommodate everyone. When the time comes to eat lunch, have the
whole group take the stairs to the roof. We've found that trying to take the
elevators with large groups can get pretty chaotic, especially when going to the
roof during lunch time (many Galvanize members all trying to get to the lobby
then).

# Workshops

## [Portfolio](workshops/portfolio)

### Prerequisites

- All leaders must complete the workshop

### Running it

- talk about the ratio / schedule of workshops to projects (to illustrate the
  point that we are only doing these workshops to give you experience to work on
  your own projects)
- today you're going to learn how to build a very basic website and learn about
  the fundamentals of building a website
- the website we are learning to emulate
  [looks like this](https://rawgit.com/hackedu/hack-camp/20618752b7afa95bbbc5c5ba80c17874ec5e0a35/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio/src/final_portfolio/index.html)
- you will be making a simpler version of that
- some of you already have a lot of experience with HTML & CSS
  - feel free to skim through or skip the guide and try to emulate the website
    or work on making a more complex or different website
  - also fee free to use your own IDEs
- Give a brief overview of HTML, CSS and JS
  - There are 3 components to a webpage
    - HTML, CSS, and Javascript
  - HTML is for the Data
  - CSS is for the look and feel
  - Javascript is for interactivity
  - Open up Facebook
    - This website has all 3
    - Open the chrome console, delete the head tag (which deletes the styles)
      - This is what a page looks like without CSS
    - These are the two we're focusing on Today
- Paste link to workshop.
  - Here is the link to the workshop
  - Talk about how it's important to ask for help
    - From facilitators
    - From your peers
    - Encourage collaboration

## Maestro

TODO

# Demos

Demos are the hackers' chance to show off what they have been putting so much
time and effort into for the past day.

- Presentation order depends on who volunteers.
- Each team should start off with something they failed at
  - Make sure to give context by explaining the basic overview of the app and
    why this is a failure
- After presenting something they failed at, they can show off what they made

## First-time demos

When explaining how to demo to hackers, first point out many things that can be
done incorrectly when demoing. Club organizers can do this by presenting fake
demos with something wrong that the hackers must point out.

Common practices to avoid when demoing:

1. Talk with no reference to your visual open (just the code).
2. Talk with your demo open but you don't reference anything onscreen.
3. Referencing things without pointing to them with your mouse.
4. Referencing things without using it or modifying it.
5. Talk about how useful a piece of code is without pointing to it.
6. Referencing your code without any code open.
7. Referencing a specific line of code without pointing to it.
8. Use the mouse pointer to point to what you say you changed but don't change
   anything.

## Giving feedback

Feedback helps hackers improve their presentation and demo skills. To keep demos
running smoothly, feedback is going to be written on sticky notes instead of
shouted out after the demo.

- Pass out sticky notes and pencils/pens to the hackers.
- Have the hackers write the number of the team on the sticky note above their
  feedback (the first team to present is team #1, the second #2, and so on).
- Collect the feedback after demos are over and sort it into groups. Then give
  the feedback to the group it is for.

# Freeform Projects

This assumes the hackers are already in groups and have decided what to work on.
If they have not yet, refer to [Brainstorming](#brainstorming).

## Scoping and concept

- Sometimes hackers will become too focused on a particular part of their project.
  - Make sure to remind them of their project's scope.
  - It is in their better interest to not focus on minor details because they
    have to finish before demos. They can continue working on details later. A
    working project is always better than a nice looking broken project.
- Explain minimum viable product to the hackers.
  - Compare MVP to building a rocket-powered flying scooter. Before building the
    rockets or polishing the wings, you must build the scooter.

## Engagement

- The activity is only beneficial to hackers that are engaged.
  - Make sure both partners are equally engaged. If they aren't, try to diagnose
    the problem.

## Facilitating

- Rotate between hackers often. Don't hover over one hacker unless they have a
  specific question that you are helping them with.

## Answering questions

- Sometimes hackers will need to be prompted to ask a question. You can prompt
  them by asking things like:

  > How is it going?
  > What can I do to be helpful?

- If a hacker does need help, make sure you have a clear understanding of the
  problem before answering.
  - Let the hackers lead the conversation so they can build up their experience
    with working on projects. Ask questions like:

    > So what do you want to do now?
    > Could you phrase that more specifically?

- Don't correct things that they discovered on their own immediately otherwise
  they will think that everything that they discover is wrong.
  - It's okay to have sub-optimal code when learning.
- Things that are interesting to a club leader might not be interesting to
  hackers. Be careful to not lecture about anything that is not directly
  relevant to the hackers.
  - A club leader's role during project time is to help the hackers solve their
    own problems. Aim for spending the least time with a hacker as possible.
    - If another hacker can help out, let that happen. Optimize for the least
      club leader time per student possible.

# Brainstorming

## Forming groups

- Assign people to groups.
  - There are social pressures between friends when forming groups. Start by
    assigning the hackers to random groups.
  - If any problems arise in a group handle it on a case-by-case basis.

First-day group pairs can be found at:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EAvdMve4Fro-xvWt3OeV7YDr4HOKDhPuAyX1oFoLqcw/edit?usp=sharing

## Yes-and sessions

- "Yes-and" sessions are exercises that help people get out of a judgmental
  mindset before brainstorming
  - In a "Yes-and" session, pairs of hackers build off each-others' ideas to
    create long, completely nonsensical ideas
- To run a "Yes-and" session, start with an example between facilitators
  - ex: https://youtu.be/Qe2a3ppacUk
  - ex: between person A and person B:

    > A: Let's create tinder for unicorns
    > B: And it will be super effective, and the unicorn population will
    > increase 1,000 times.
    > A: Yes, and there won't be enough food for the unicorns
    > B: So they'll build a spaceship to search for new planets to colonize!

- Have the hackers jump into a "Yes-and session" for 4 minutes then let
  volunteer to present the stories that unfolded.

## Running a brainstorm session

- Remind the hackers how brainstorming works

  1. THERE ARE NO BAD IDEAS IN BRAINSTORMING
  2. Go for quantity of ideas
  3. Write down your ideas on post-it notes
  4. Say an idea out loud when writing it down

## After a brainstorm

- This is when you can start sorting and judging the ideas
  - Group post-it notes into similar concepts or ideas
- Hackers should chose two or three ideas they are interested in working on.
- Organizers can help them narrow their final decision down to one idea.
  - It is important that organizers review project ideas before hackers start
    working
- Explain the concept of MVP and help the hackers scope their project
  - Building a large project can take a long time. We want to build the least
    amount that we have to in the next day, so we'll only build the core
    features
  - Organizers must make sure the scope of the project is something the hackers
    can handle in the time they are given.

# "I have failed" activity

This activity will:

- Enable people to acknowledge their failures because they know that the
  response they will be met with support, not judgment
- It gives everyone else an appropriate response when someone fails so they know
  what to do.

Demos will involve failing in front of the whole club. This activity is a good
preface to get the hackers into a positive mindset about public failure. It is
important to be supportive when someone fails publicly.

1. Have everyone form a circle (including club leaders).
2. Explain to the hackers the goal of this activity.
3. Explain that everyone will be sharing something they failed at
   - These should be things that they have not resolved yet
   - When they share it, they must shout it out in an overly dramatic way
4. Start by having the club leaders saying something they failed at, then go
   through the circle
   - Applaud and cheer when someone shares their failure

Here are good example failures that haven't been resolved:

  > I showed up late today!
  >
  > I didn't have enough time to make my site the way I wanted to!
  >
  > I didn't ask for help when I needed it!

# Feedback Forms

At the end of each day we want to collect feedback from the hackers to see what
did/didn't do well and understand how the hackers feel about camp as it
progresses. The feedback may also be helpful to diagnose issues with certain
parts of camp (ex. the second workshop was particularly difficult and many
people got lost and felt frustrated the day after).

When giving the feedback forms to the hackers, it is _very important_ that the
hackers feel that giving feedback is important. We don't want them to feel like
they're filling out the forms to appease us. Rather, we want them filling out
the forms because they want camp to be as good as possible and they know that
giving valuable feedback improves camp for everyone.

Making hackers feel like giving feedback is important can be broken down into
two parts:

1. Telling them why we want their feedback
2. Actually acting on their feedback and _showing_ that it makes a difference

When it comes time to send out feedback forms to everyone, we recommend saying
something along the lines of:

> Hey everyone! We're going to send out a link to a feedback form for today. We
> want to do _everything we can_ to make camp as good as possible and we can't
> do this without you.
>
> Please be as harsh and critical as you feel comfortable, we are going to do
> everything in our power to make this a great experience for each and every one
> of you.

Before going into the [post-mortem](#post-mortem) at the end of the day, we
highly recommend reviewing the feedback from the hackers and bringing up any
points of feedback that stand out to you in the post-mortem so it can be acted
on.

All of the feedback form responses will be put into the appropriate sheet in
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D8y_UB11C4QrXB9kn86-UqVQQqT9FUDqftx1AMHIb3o.

# Finishing off the day

Congratulations! We made it!

We generally do two final things to finish off the day.

1. Make any final announcements for the following day
2. Gather everyone in a nice and cozy circle near the front of the hackerspace,
   put our hands in, and, on three, all yell "Hack!"

# Post-mortem

The post-mortem is a meeting between everyone involved in running Hack Camp and
is our opportunity to review the day and plan for the next.

During the post-mortem we'll visit each row in the schedule for the day (see
[`SCHEDULE.md`](SCHEDULE.md) for the daily schedules) and have everyone in the
meeting share any thoughts/notes on that item. As we're reading through each
row, we'll be deciding tasks for that evening and things to do for the following
day.

For example, if the following is the schedule for the day:

| Time     | Activity     |
| -------- | ------------ |
| 9:20 AM  | Energizer    |
| 9:45 AM  | Breakfast    |
| 10:15 AM | Project time |

The agenda for the post-mortem will be:

1. Energizer
2. Breakfast
3. Project time

We'll be doing our best to keep the post-mortems as brief as possible, so
_please come prepared with what you want to bring up for each item in the
post-mortem's agenda_.

# Using Slack

We've gone ahead and created a Slack for Hack Camp over at
https://hack-camp.slack.com to use as a place for communicating with hackers
during the camp.

All of the leaders of Hack Camp should have administrative access to the Slack.
If you're a leader and you find that you aren't an administrator, shoot
[@zachlatta](https://github.com/zachlatta) a message and he'll make sure that
changes.

## Asking for help

If a hacker says `slackbot help` in anywhere besides a PM in the Slack, all of
the technical mentors for Hack Camp will be pinged. For example:

```
> 3:35 PM <mahahahajan> slackbot help
> 3:35 PM <slackbot> gemma jonleung maxw rolandocruz saescapa selynna zrl
```

If you'd like to be added/removed from the list, let
[@zachlatta](https://github.com/zachlatta) know and he'll get right on it (say
`slackbot help` somewhere in the chat to see who's currently on the list).
