# General Overview

Hack Camp is broken up into _workshops_ and _projects_.

- Workshops introduce new concepts
- Projects help solidify the hackers' understanding of introduced concepts

Legend:

- **W** - Workshop
- **P** - Free-form project time
- **D** - Demos
- **MD** - Mini-demos. Shorter demos of work-in-progress. Things aren't expected
  to be finished yet.

Each column indicated the flow of the day. If a row containing **W** is followed
by **F** in the following row in the same column, that means that a workshop
will be followed by project-time that day.
