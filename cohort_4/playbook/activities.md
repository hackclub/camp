# Activities

## Hacker arrival

1. Assign a leader to manage hacker arrival.
2. Have the assigned leader text all of the hackers the morning of with
   something along the lines of the following:

   > Hey Alice! Can't wait to see you this morning. Just as a quick reminder,
   > the address is 44 Tehama Street in San Francisco. Can you shoot me a text
   > or give me a call when you get here?

3. Have the assigned leader wait in the lobby for arriving hackers.
4. When a hacker arrives, have the assigned leader guide them down to the
   hackerspace in the basement, mark their arrival in the
   [attendance sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Em5tUQdm4dXnthtWr4zY4KR9Q6JZMV_Hl2n6G9Ti9Bg/edit),
   and then head back up to the lobby to wait for more arriving hackers.

It may be a good idea to play some music in the hackerspace while people are
arriving.

## Meals

### Lunch

On the first day, eat lunch as a large group. On all of the other days, give the
hackers freedom for the entire lunch period.

When eating lunch as a large group, have a designated lunch area and take the
stairs there. If you try and take the elevator, there's a good chance things
will get chaotic, especially with other Galvanize members trying to get to the
first floor with the elevators.

## Workshops

### [Portfolio](workshops/portfolio)

#### Prerequisites

- All leaders must complete the workshop

#### Running it

TODO

## Demos

Demos are the hackers' chance to show off what they have been putting so much
time and effort into for the past day.

- Presentation order depends on who volunteers.
- Each team should start off with something they failed at
  - Make sure to give context by explaining the basic overview of the app and
    why this is a failure
- After presenting something they failed at, they can show off what they made

### Giving feedback

Feedback helps hackers improve their presentation and demo skills. To keep demos
running smoothly, feedback is going to be written on sticky notes instead of
shouted out after the demo.

- Pass out sticky notes and pencils/pens to the hackers.
- Have the hackers write the number of the team on the sticky note above their
  feedback (the first team to present is team #1, the second #2, and so on).
- Collect the feedback after demos are over and sort it into groups. Then give
  the feedback to the group it is for.

## Freeform Projects

This assumes the hackers are already in groups and have decided what to work on.
If they have not yet, refer to [Brainstorming](#brainstorming).

### Scoping and concept

- Sometimes hackers will become too focused on a particular part of their project.
  - Make sure to remind them of their project's scope.
  - It is in their better interest to not focus on minor details because they
    have to finish before demos. They can continue working on details later. A
    working project is always better than a nice looking broken project.
- Explain minimum viable product to the hackers.
  - Compare MVP to building a rocket-powered flying scooter. Before building the
    rockets or polishing the wings, you must build the scooter.

### Engagement

- The activity is only beneficial to hackers that are engaged.
  - Make sure both partners are equally engaged. If they aren't, try to diagnose
    the problem.

### Facilitating

- Rotate between hackers often. Don't hover over one hacker unless they have a
  specific question that you are helping them with.

### Answering questions

- Sometimes hackers will need to be prompted to ask a question. You can prompt
  them by asking things like:

  > How is it going?
  > What can I do to be helpful?

- If a hacker does need help, make sure you have a clear understanding of the
  problem before answering.
  - Let the hackers lead the conversation so they can build up their experience
    with working on projects. Ask questions like:

    > So what do you want to do now?
    > Could you phrase that more specifically?

- Don't correct things that they discovered on their own immediately otherwise
  they will think that everything that they discover is wrong.
  - It's okay to have sub-optimal code when learning.
- Things that are interesting to a club leader might not be interesting to
  hackers. Be careful to not lecture about anything that is not directly
  relevant to the hackers.
  - A club leader's role during project time is to help the hackers solve their
    own problems. Aim for spending the least time with a hacker as possible.
    - If another hacker can help out, let that happen. Optimize for the least
      club leader time per student possible.

## "I have failed" activity

This activity will:
  - Enable people to acknowledge their failures because they know that the
    response they will be met with support, not judgment
  - It gives everyone else an appropriate response when someone fails so they
    know what to do
Demos will involve failing infront of the whole club. This activity is a good
preface to get the hackers into a positive mindset about public failure. It is
important to be supportive when someone fails publicly.

1. Have everyone form a circle (including club leaders).
2. Explain to the hackers the goal of this activity.
3. Explain that everyone will be sharing something they failed at
   - These should be things that they have not resolved yet
   - When they share it, they must shout it out in an overly dramatic way
4. Start by having the club leaders saying something they failed at, then go
   through the circle
   - Applaud and cheer when someone shares their failure

Here are good example failures that haven't been resolved:

  > I showed up late today!

  > I didn't have enough time to make my site the way I wanted to!

  > I didn't ask for help when I needed it!

## Feedback Forms

All of the feedback form responses will be put into the appropriate sheet in
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D8y_UB11C4QrXB9kn86-UqVQQqT9FUDqftx1AMHIb3o.
