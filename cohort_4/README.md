## Culture

### Freedom

#### For us

In Hack Camp, we are going to be doing X, Y, and Z. However, if you _really_
don't want to do something, you don't have to. And if you feel uncomfortable
doing something, let us know and we'll do our best to work with you.

#### For the hackers

Everything is optional. In Hack Camp we will be following this set schedule, and
if you'd like to deviate, please do so. However, if you don't follow along with
the workshops or don't build projects on our schedule, chances are you'll fall
behind - the choice is up to you.

#### Phrasing

When it comes to showing hackers things, don't phrase things as "this is how you
do things." Instead, phrase things as "this is how I do things".

#### Whether things are mandatory

Things are not mandatory.
