            Hack Camp is for high school students who want to
            create apps, build websites, and make games. Over two
            exhilerating weeks, you'll learn fundamental skills
            transferable to game and app development. We welcome
            girls and boys ages 14-18, no prior experience necessary.
            Young adults with some experience are welcome as well, of
            course. Please bring your own laptop.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Hack Camp costs $595 for the two-week program. However, inclusivity
            is extremely important to us and we are readily offering full need-based
            financial aid (see the question on the application form).
